# React example app with Next.js

This is an example app using react and next.js in order to create an isomorphic application with next.js

the syntaxis of next.js is very simple and you can start using it in minutes having all advantages of this kind of applications, next.js is a very useful resource to start creating isomorphic applications.

site deployed: https://hello-next.eisson.now.sh/

to deploy in next.js server just made changes or add new features and then run 

```bash
npm run deploy
```

or simply 
```bash
now
```

remember install now and login

if you want to deploy in your own environment run

```bash
npm run build
```

Then, you need to start your Next.js app on a port. This server will do server-side rendering and serve static pages (built with the above command).

For that, now run the start script:
```bash
npm run start
```

Now you can see our app running here: http://localhost:3000
